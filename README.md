1. Introduction
  <br />1.1 Overview: This report aims to introduce a modern method of shopping and the various processes involved in the web and mobile application, List Assist. The redesigned software consists of actions such as creating lists, locally storing lists, sharing lists with others, setting desired budgets, and a UPC barcode scanning system to manage user lists or budgets. This shopping list and scanner application attempts to help users by curbing impulse buys, staying on budget, and never having to call home and ask, “what else did we need?” again! The report depicts basic logic through several different diagrams and a prototype demonstration that are used for the application presented below. 
  <br />1.2 Purpose: To develop an application aimed towards all individuals. Providing them with the ability to become more efficient and effective shoppers. The use of the application will save its users money and time, which can be accomplished with the unique features presented in the shopping application. Automatically manage lists and track expenses in real time through the use of barcode scanning. The application will ensure that individuals are purchasing only what they need and are spending what they can afford.
  <br />1.3 Scope: The major functions of the List Assist software are to create, manage, and share shopping lists. In addition, users can update shopping lists through the use of UPC barcode scanning. The software will be developed for mobile devices (android and apple operating systems), as well as a website using the object-oriented analysis and design approach.
  <br /> a. Registered shoppers and guest shoppers must have the List Assist application downloaded on an Android or Apple device in order to be able to use it.
  <br /> b. Using the List Assist application as a guest is limited only to the primary features. The guest user must register to be able to share lists and access other features of the software.
  <br /> c. List Assist data is stored in the default internal directory of the application folder of the mobile device.
  <br /> d. Efficient shopping list and budget managing through the use of barcode scanning.
2. Positioning
  <br /> 2.1 Business Opportunity: Despite the fact that there are numerous shopping applications we are competing against, none of them have the encompassing amount of unique and viable features, in which List Assist has incorporated all into one application. These features are comprised of a scanner to automatically manage lists and adjust a running total, as well as an emphasis on its immense potential for sharing lists with others.
  <br /> 2.2 Problem Statement: For the shopper, who is eager to save money and time while shopping for goods. List Assist is a service based grocery shopping mobile application that allows users to manage shopping lists, budgets, keep track of goods, and have a better understanding of their spending habits. Unlike our competitors, namely List Tonic and GroceryIQ, our product allows users to automatically manage shopping lists and set desired budgets, through the use of barcode scanning. It’s the combination of unique  features that puts our application at a competitive advantage over the others.
